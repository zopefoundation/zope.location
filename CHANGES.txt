3.5.1 (unreleased)
------------------

- Improve test coverage.

- The new ``getParents`` method was extracted from ``zope.traversing``
  and added to ILocationInfo interface in the previous release. Custom
  ILocationInfo implementations should make sure they have this method
  as well. That method is already used in ``zope.traversing.api.getParents``
  function.

- Make ``getName`` of ILocationInfo always return empty string for
  the IRoot object, like RootPhysicallyLocatable from zope.traversing
  did, making the latter one obsolete.

- Change package mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org instead
  of retired zope3-dev at zope.org.

3.5.0 (2009-01-31)
------------------

- Reverse the dependency between zope.location and zope.traversing. This
  also causes the dependency to various other packages go away.

3.4.0 (2007-10-02)
------------------

- Initial release independent of the main Zope tree.
